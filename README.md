A wizard table preview software, currently only some of the basic features, there should be no further updates are planned. 
It automatically cuts out the solid color or transparent border around the image you choose, and then cuts and loops the animation in sequence; 
if you select an image that is too large, there will also be a certain amount of compression to make sure the program runs smoothly, with limited capabilities, or a little bit of Cottonwood. 
Mainly did not find the corresponding software on the internet, almost all will sequence frame into the wizard map, there is no wizard map preview of a convenient software. 
Texture Packer was the only one that looked like this, but it didn&#039;t have this preview feature either. 
It was too much trouble to put it in another app, and I didnt bother to configure it, so I made a nice little preview app, 
if you know the software that has the same effect, welcome to leave a message, what I do is still too simple.

一个精灵表的预览软件，目前只有一些基础的功能，应该不会有进一步的更新打算。它会自动剪裁掉你选择图片周边的纯色或者透明边框，然后进行分割，顺序循环播放其中的动画；如果你选择的图片过大，也会进行一定的压缩来确保程序运行顺畅，能力有限还是会有点卡顿。
主要是没在网上找到对应的软件，几乎都是将序列帧变为精灵图，没有对精灵图预览的一个方便的软件。找到类似的只有texture packer,但是也没有这个预览功能好像，放到别的软件再看太麻烦了，而且懒得配置，所以做了一个小巧的预览软件，如果你知道有同样作用的软件，欢迎留言，我自己做的还是太简陋了。
